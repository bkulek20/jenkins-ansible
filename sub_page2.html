        <h2>In this post, I’ll walk through how I deployed my personal portfolio site on an AWS EC2 instance using NGINX.</h2>
      
        <h3>1. Launching a Linux EC2 Instance</h3>
        <p>
          I launched a new EC2 instance named <strong>nginx-test2</strong> in the <strong>eu-west-1</strong> region.<br>
          By default, AWS placed the instance in a private subnet within the default VPC.<br>
          Although a public IP was assigned, there was no route to an Internet Gateway (IGW) in the subnet’s route table — meaning the instance had no outbound internet access.<br>
          Thus, I cannot connect my EC2 instance.
        </p>
        <p><u>To resolve this:</u></p>
        <ul>
          <li>I created a new Internet Gateway (IGW).</li>
          <li>Updated the Route Table to direct <code>0.0.0.0/0</code> traffic to the IGW.</li>
          <li>Created a new public subnet and associated it with this route table.</li>
          <li>Launched my EC2 instance within this new public subnet.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once launched, I was able to connect without issues.</p>
      
        <h3>2. Taking a Snapshot After Installation</h3>
        <p>
          To preserve the clean, post-install state of my EC2 instance, I took a snapshot of its EBS volume:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Navigated to <strong>EC2 &gt; Elastic Block Store &gt; Volumes</strong></li>
          <li>Selected the volume and clicked <strong>Actions &gt; Create Snapshot</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>This snapshot (named <code>nginx-ss-bkulek</code>) allows me to recreate identical EC2 instances anytime via “Create Volume” &gt; “Launch instance from volume.”</p>
      
        <h3>3. Restricting SSH Access to My IP</h3>
        <!-- <p>For security, I locked down SSH access:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Went to <strong>Security Groups &gt; Edit Inbound Rules</strong></li>
          <li>Changed the SSH rule’s source from <code>0.0.0.0/0</code> to my own IP (<code>163.116.166.153/32</code>)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Now, only my IP can access port 22 on this server.</p> -->
      
        <h3>4. Installing a Web Server</h3>
        <p>I installed NGINX on my Amazon Linux instance:</p>
        <pre>
      sudo yum -y update
      sudo yum -y install nginx
      sudo systemctl start nginx
      sudo systemctl enable nginx
        </pre>
        <p>Then I visited <a href="http://54.229.246.19" target="_blank">http://54.229.246.19</a> (my instance’s public IP), and saw the NGINX welcome page — success!</p>
      
        <h3>5. Hosting My Portfolio Website</h3>
        <p>I cloned my GitHub repository and copied it to the NGINX root directory:</p>
        <pre>
      sudo yum install git -y
      cd /tmp
      git clone https://github.com/bkulek20/MyPortfolio2.git
      sudo cp -r MyPortfolio2/* /usr/share/nginx/html/
      sudo systemctl restart nginx
        </pre>
        <p>Then, I could see my portfolio website live.</p>
      
        <h3>6. Blocking Access to /admin Page</h3>
        <p>To restrict access to /admin, I edited the NGINX configuration:</p>
        <pre>
      sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
        </pre>
        <p>Inside the <code>server { ... }</code> block, I added:</p>
        <pre>
      location /admin {
          allow 163.116.166.153;
          deny all;
      }
        </pre>
        <pre>
      sudo systemctl reload nginx
        </pre>
        <p>Only my IP could access /admin.</p>
      
        <h3>7. Monitoring CPU, Memory, and Process Usage</h3>
        <p>Before and after installing NGINX, I checked system resource usage.</p>
        <p><strong>CPU + Memory Summary:</strong></p>
        <pre>
      top -n 1 | head -10
      # Before: CPU usage was 0%, system was idle
      # After: CPU usage was increased to 5.9%, which means nginx starts to use cpu.
        </pre>
      
        <p><strong>RAM Usage:</strong></p>
        <pre>
      free -m
      # RAM usage increased after NGINX installation (from 148MB to 161MB)
        </pre>
      
        <p><strong>Top RAM-consuming Processes:</strong></p>
        <pre>
      ps aux --sort=-%mem | head
      # NGINX didn’t even make the top 10 — it’s lightweight.
        </pre>
      
        <h3>8. Viewing Access and Error Logs</h3>
        <p>To verify live site activity and debug errors, I used:</p>
        <pre>
      sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/access.log
      sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log
        </pre>
        <p>
          <strong>Access Log:</strong> Confirmed the last site visit timestamp<br>
          <strong>Error Log:</strong> Logs if any error occurs
        </p>
      
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
          From subnet routing to secure access and resource monitoring — 
          this setup gave me full control over how my portfolio site is deployed and served.
